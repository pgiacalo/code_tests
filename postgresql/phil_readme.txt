My experiments with a postgresql database created on AWS RDA are found on the Ubuntu 14.04 VirtualBox. 
Ubuntu was the best choice for experiments with Postgresql.

The Ubuntu instance can be launched on the MacBook Pro from here:
   ~/dev/virtual_machines/ubuntu1404

Type vagrant up		# starts the ubuntu instance on the vm
Type vagrant ssh	# logs into the ubuntu instance as user 'vagrant'

Navigate to here on the ubuntu virtual box:
   ~/code_tests/postgresql
